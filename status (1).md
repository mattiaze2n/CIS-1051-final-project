Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
I looked into predictive analytics in python, understood the requirements for building a machine learning model. I looked into the library commonly used for Exploratory 
Data Analysis (Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy) and I looked into scikit learn for the model training and testing.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
I haven't implemented anything yet. I started working on the code but mostly for practicing using the different libraries and not for the actual project.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
The main problem I encountered right now is using the different libraries. Since I haven't used any of them before everytime I have to look up the documentation and understand how to use the tools for my project.
