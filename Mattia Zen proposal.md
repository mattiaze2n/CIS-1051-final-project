# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Python Wine Quality Analysis 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
I want to build a machine learning model that will predict wine quality based on chemical features.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The first part of my project will analyze the data set, to check for correlation between data. Once the exploratory 
data analysis is done I will train the model with part of the data set and use the remainng part to test the accuracy.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A good final outcome for me will be completing the exploratory data analysis and building the model. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A better outcome would be having a fully functioning model with accuracy close to 70%.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome for my final project will be having an accuracy score of 90% and having the model fully functioning also with other datasets.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
My first step is learning more about maching learning: how to structure the work, the most common library used and how to build a model. Once I acquired this knowledge I will looking more deepl into the libraries used. Once I have a better understanding of the overall project I will start with the exploratory data analysis. Once the EDA is completed I have a clear understaing of the dataset and machine learning and I will be able to actually build the model. When the model is done I plan to test is and work on possibile mistakes and corrections.
